Mega Man 66
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Mega Man 66 is a basic Mega Man platformer tribute of the classic Mega Man games from the NES, using 
the sprites from the playable character and levels of Mega Man (1987).

This tribute has been made by David Varela and David Valdivia, two students from the UPC videogames degree.

Github:
When we started making the game we had a problem with the girtignore file, so we changed or repository. The repositories
are in order from the first to the second we used.
