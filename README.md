Mega Man Requiem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Mega Man Requiem is a basic Mega Man platformer tribute of the classic Mega Man games from the NES, using 
the sprites from the playable character and levels of Mega Man (1987).

This tribute has been made by David Varela and David Valdivia, two students from the UPC videogames degree.

Github:
When we started making the game we had a problem with the girtignore file, so we changed or repository. The repositories
are in order from the first to the last we used. THE LAST REPOSITORY IS THE ONE USED FOR THE SECOND ASSIGNEMENT.
The only changes done before changing to the Requiem repository are fixing problems from the first assignement.
